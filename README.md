Yuchao's Hot Chicken Restaurant Webpage
Yuchao's Hot Chicken has existed since the inception of the Ming Dynasty.  Master Yuchao Tong has passed down his yummy fried chicken recipe through the generations until it finally reached his fifth-generation male descendant.
Thus, the first Yuchao's Hot Chicken restaurant opened in 1906, serving the good people of Fargo, North Dakota ever since!  I hope you will take the pleasure of joining Yuchao in his magical quest for yummy chicken!
